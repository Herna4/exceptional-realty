        <!-- <p>This lesson is all about formatting text in HTML. <br> Let's start off by typing Hello World inside the <body> tags, since we know from the previous lesson that all viewable page content is in the <body>. Open index.html in your browser or start up httpserver and check out your website. </p>
        <p>Cool, we've got text on the page! Go back to your editor, and hit return twice so you're two lines below Hello World, and type Hello Moon. Great, but very plain. In order to actually format text, we will need to use HTML elements.</p>
